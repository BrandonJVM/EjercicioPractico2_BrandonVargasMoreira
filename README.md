# Ejercicio Practico 2 - Brandon Vargas Moreira

## Port 95 Issues, Port 78 Used Instead :)

Hi Mel,

I just want to let you know that Iâ€™m doing my best to complete this project in the best possible way. Iâ€™m the type of student who doesnâ€™t like leaving things halfway. That being said, I got a bit confused at the beginning, and the project didnâ€™t work for a whole hour. However, weâ€™re pushing through, and Iâ€™m confident weâ€™ll make it happen! ðŸ˜Š
